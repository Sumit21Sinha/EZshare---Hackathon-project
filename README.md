This is our Hackathon Project.

We are developing a website "EZshare" that will enable students living in hostels to request items such as medicines, kettles, plates, and more from other students when needed.
Likewise, it will allow students to lend their belongings to others when required on a temporary basis. 
The website will also feature a chat section to facilitate communication between both parties, allowing them to discuss, negotiate, and reach a mutually satisfactory arrangement for borrowing and lending items.

Members -> Sumit Sinha, Arjun Angirus, Rahul Gupta.
